         Assignment- 1

    Q1 Find the invalid given identifier?
    1.var 2ndplace;
    2.var my-variable;
    3.var var;
    4.var first name;
    5.var @variable;

    Ans-   1,2,3,4,5 are invalid identifier

    Q2.what is the scope of a variable declared using var ,let and constant ?
    ans- The scope of a var variable is a global scope or functional scope .
    The scope of a let variable is a block scope 
    the scope of a constant variable is block scope .

    Q3.What will be the output for this given programme?
    
    fucntion testvariable()
    {
    console.log(a);
    if (true)
    {
    var a = 10;
    let b =20;
    const c= 30;
    }
    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);
    console.log(c);
    }
   testvariables();
   output- undefined

  Q4.what are the data type in javascript ?
  Ans- In java script, data types refer to the types of values that variable can hold.


  Q5.what are the primitive data type in java script?
  Ans- string ,number ,boolean , null, undefined and symbol are primitive data type .in java script.
 
  Q6.what are the differences between the primitive data types and reference data type?
 
  ANS-Primitive data type- these are the data type provided by java.there size is fixed.
 string,null ,etc are the example of primitive data type.
  References data type-these are the data type created by a programmer.there size is depend on the number of member variable and their type.object ,function etc are the example of references data type

  Q7.what are the different ways to create a string in javascript?
  Ans-we can create string by wrapping the text inside 
  single quote(')
  double quote(")
  backticks(')

  Q8 How do you check the data types of a variable in javascript ?
 ANS -we can use "the type of "operator to find the data type of a java script variable.







							ASSIGNMENT-2

   Q1  . What is the differences between unary ,binary and ternary operators in javascript ?provide example of each?
   ANS- UNARY OPERATORS- These operators requires one operand for operation .providing two or more can result in a syntax error .
   for example- let x= 10;
                      let y= +x 
                     console.log(y);    
                     output-10
     if we place the unary plus before a numeric value it does nothing 
    when we apply the unary plus operator to a non numeric value,it perform a number conversion using the number()

      Binary operators- the operator requires two operand for operation .
      for example-
      arithmetic operation  -          10+20  //30
      comparison operators -       80<20   //false
      Assignment operators-       const number =20

      
      Ternary operators- the operator required three operands.
      for example- let age=15;
                     
           let result;
           if(age>= 18)
        {
         result= "you are eligible to vote";
       }else
      {
        result="you are not eligible to vote";
       }
       console.log(result);

      output- you are not eligible to vote


     Q2  explain the concept of short circuit  evaluation in the context of logical operators. provide an example
    ans-The logical AND operator performs short-circuit evaluation: if the left-hand operand is false, the right-hand expression is not evaluated. The logical OR operator also performs short-circuit evaluation: if the left-hand operand is true, the right-hand expression is not evaluated.
   for example-
   console.log(3 || 'Orange');
   console.log('' || 'Orange');
   console.log(true || 0);
   console.log(undefined || null);

   output-
   3
   Orange
   true
   null

   example2-
   console.log(0 && 'Orange');
   console.log('' && 'Orange');
   console.log(true && null);
   console.log('Apple' && 'Orange');
   

   output- 
   0

   null
   Orange


   Q3.Given the following code snippet whAT will be the output?
  
   let x = 5;
   let y = "10";
   let z = x + y;
   console.log(z);

   output= 510


   Q4.write the javascript function named calculate area that take the radius of a circle as a parameter and returns the area of the circle .use the appropriate arithmetic operators 
  

      function calculateArea(radius)
      {
      const PI= math.PI;
      let area= PI * radius * radius;
      return area;
      }
   
    
   Q5.explain the difference between the equality operator (==)and strict equality operator (===)in javascript .
   
      equal operator-
   ans - = JavaScript operator assigns a value to the left operand depends on the value of operand available on the right side. The first operand should be a variable.

    The basic assignment operator is =, that assigns the value of one operand to another. That is, a = b assigns the value of b to a.

   equality operator-
   Double equals (==) is a comparison operator, which transforms the operands having the same type before comparison. its check the data type.



   strict operator-
   Strict equality === checks that two values are the same or not.
  if the variable values are of different types, then the values are considered as unequal.
  itwill check the value as well as data type also.

   

   Q6.write a program to convert fahrenheit to celsius?
 
      function fahrenheittoCelsius(f)
     {
      let c=(f-32)*5/9;
      return c;
     }

     console.log(fahrenheittoCelsius(32));   //0
     console.log(fahrenheittoCelsius(68));  //20
     console.log(fahrenheittoCelsius(100));  //37.777777
